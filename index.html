        <p style="text-align: center;">Mewing is a technique for enhancing your jawline. In this tutorial, <br>
            you will learn all about mewing.</p>

        <h2 class="mewingexplained">What Is Mewing?</h2>
        <p>Mewing, developed by Dr. John Mew in the 1970s, is a tongue posture technique aimed at improving  <br>
            facial structure and jaw alignment. He believed modern habits like poor posture and soft diets <br>
             were messing up natural development. His son, Dr. Mike Mew, popularized the method online in the 2000s, <br>
             turning it into a viral trend by the 2010s as a natural alternative for better jawlines and breathing. <br>
        </p>

        <h2 class="howto">How To Mew</h2>
        <p>
            Mewing is about pressing your entire tongue gently but firmly 
            against the roof of your mouth, with the tip just behind your front teeth.
            Keep your lips closed, breathe through your nose, and maintain good posture
            with your chin slightly tucked. Consistency is key for results over time.
