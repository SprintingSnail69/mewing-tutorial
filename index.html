        <p style="text-align: center;">Mewing is a technique for enhancing your jawline. In this tutorial, <br>
            you will learn all about mewing.</p>

        <h2 class="mewingexplained">What Is Mewing?</h2>
        <p>Mewing, developed by Dr. John Mew in the 1970s, is a tongue posture technique aimed at improving  <br>
            facial structure and jaw alignment. He believed modern habits like poor posture and soft diets <br>
             were messing up natural development. His son, Dr. Mike Mew, popularized the method online in the 2000s, <br>
             turning it into a viral trend by the 2010s as a natural alternative for better jawlines and breathing. <br>
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="howto">How To Mew</h2>
        <p>
            Mewing is about pressing your entire tongue gently but firmly <br>
            against the roof of your mouth, with the tip just behind your front teeth. <br>
            Keep your lips closed, breathe through your nose, and maintain good posture <br>
            with your chin slightly tucked. Consistency is key for results over time. <br>
